                                                           Usually most of the people moving from Boston to Long Island because you got the job or

                                                            Long Island is the cheapest place to live outside of the New York City area because it’s
                                                            a far commute to the city that’s why it’s making it a little bit cheaper. Long Island on

                                                            it attractive for living because of the good areas and good neighbors around Long Island
