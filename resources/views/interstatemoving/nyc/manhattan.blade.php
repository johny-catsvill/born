                                                            for either <a href="https://www.goborntomove.com/packing-solution">full packing</a> or <strong>kitchen packing</strong> or you decide to pack up on your own. We highly
                                                            recommend you use smaller boxes for books and for the kitchen. Please buy lots of packing paper for
                                                            the kitchen and dishes. <strong>Almost all buildings in New York require a COI</strong> which is a certificate of
                                                            insurance. Born to move movers  want to take care of this in advance and if you’re fully committed
                                                            and decided to move forward with our moving company. Always ask management to give you requirements
                                                            at least a week before. In order for us to submit a COi to our insurance company, they can get back
                                                            to us with a proper certificate of insurance. Moving can be tough and stressful. Our movers want to
                                                            make sure everything will go smoothly. Movers from Boston to Manhattan  will start in Boston the day
                                                            before will pack up the stuff and move to the truck. <strong>We will keep your items overnight</strong> in our truck
                                                            then <strong>we will drive at night at 3 AM</strong> just to be at the destination at Manhattan on the next day around
                                                            9 AM in the morning. The reason for that is that buildings can be very strict with the service elevator
                                                            that you have to reserve in advance as well. We want to make sure we can beat the traffic because
                                                            traffic starts very early and traffic usually hits I-95 around 5 AM in the morning. Our moving company
                                                            wants to make sure that we will be on time in <strong>Manhattan</strong>. If you decide that you want to perform the same
                                                            day moving from Boston to Manhattan the price will be around $300 more than the original price. Reason
                                                            for that is because we will have to rent a hotel on the way back, we are not sure what time we will be
                                                            coming back to Boston from Manhattan. We also want to make sure that we will properly wrap every single
                                                            piece of furniture. Movers will have a variety of tools to perform the job by <strong>disassembling the bed and
                                                            then putting it back everything together</strong>. Some of our customers ask if we can take a ride with us on the
