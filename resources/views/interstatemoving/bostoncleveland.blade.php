                                                        Sometimes our customers just don’t realize how much stuff they have until it’s time to move. You likely have slightly more boxes than you planned.
Your room will be looking like storage so that’s why if you have a little bit more stuff to move our company will not charge you a lot if you have slight changes in the inventory.
But please if you can tell us in advance that you all have changes on the inventory a representative will adjust the Flat rate before moving date. During your relocation from Massachusetts to Ohio your belongings will be fully insured up to $20,000. Please contact our representative to get more information on the flight rates from Boston to Cleveland OH.
