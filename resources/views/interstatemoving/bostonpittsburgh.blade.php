                                                        An average move will cost around <strong>2500$</strong>.
But it depends on the amount of furniture that you have plus take into consideration that the long-distance moves can be tricky. It also depends on when do you want to get your belongings delivered to the destination at Pittsburgh. If you move in just a few pieces of furniture, of course, it will be less money then we mentioned before. But if you move the whole house it will be more than 2500$. That’s why you can talk with a representative and he can guarantee a flat rate for your move from Boston to Pittsburgh.
